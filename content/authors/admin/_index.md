#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I am research assistant in Brain Mapping Lab, at University of Tehran, Iran, under supervision of Prof. Hossein-Zadeh. I hold M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering majoring Bioelectrics from University of Tehran. I've also served as teaching assistant at Sharif University of Technology and Neuromatch Academy, mentoring students in deep learning and biomedical image analysis. I am interested in both fundamental and applied research. Specifically, my research interests lie in the areas of probabilistic machine learning (broadly interpreted), deep learning, causality, generative AI, robust & trustworthy ML, and application of AI algorithms in vision & medical imaging.
